# Overview
betAware is a financial wellness tool designed to educate users about the risks of gambling addiction while promoting healthier money habits. Through gamification and actionable insights, it's to help users break the cycle of gambling and build sustainable wealth.
## Inspiration  
The explosion of online sports betting is creating a hidden crisis. Many people are falling into financial hardship and emotional stress without realizing it.  

This problem feels very personal to me — I lost a few thousand dollars through betting. I experienced firsthand how easy it is to lose control.  

That's why we built BetAware: to offer a gentle, supportive way for people to reflect on their habits, protect their peace of mind, and avoid the same mistakes.  

## What It Does  
- **Odds Reality Check**: Shows the real chances of winning and the true value of a bet  
- **Loss Simulator**: Visualizes how quickly losses accumulate  
- **Risk Profile**: Provides personalized warnings and tips based on user habits  
- **SmartPlay Mode**: Lets users test strategies with fake money instead of real cash  
- **Bite-sized Lessons**: Delivers quick safety advice  

## What We Learned  
- Sensitive topics need careful UX and thoughtful communication  
- Positive encouragement works better than warnings  
- Simple tools make a huge difference when designed with care  

## How We Built It  
**Tech Stack**:  
- Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- TailwindCSS  

## Accomplishments  
- Built a compassionate tool addressing a serious problem  
- Mindful habit-tracking through beautiful design  
- Highlighted betting dangers without negativity  

## Challenges  
- Designing non-judgmental messaging  
- Visualizing risk without overwhelming users  

## What's Next  
- Add emotional health resources (calming exercises)  
- Partner with addiction recovery nonprofits  
- Expand to gaming/day-trading addictions
